# OmicsIntegrator2

This repository is premised on a set of ideas we've been developing recently. The principal objective is a 100x speed increase from front to back, building on GarNet2 and Ludwig's PCSF implementation.

Let us know if you'd like to be part of this project. We anticipate most of the work will happen in late February.
